# **Encryption and Decryption Tool**

This tool provides a simple graphical interface for encrypting and decrypting text using a basic letter-shifting algorithm. It utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

# **Decryption Script**

**dec.py**

This script enables the decryption of a string using a simple letter-shifting algorithm. Each character in the input string is shifted back by one position, essentially reversing the encryption process.

**Usage**

-Run the script dec.py.
-Enter the encrypted text in the provided input field.
-Click the "Decrypt" button to view the decrypted text.

# **Encryption Script**

**enc.py**

This script facilitates the encryption of text using a basic letter-shifting algorithm. Each character in the input string is shifted forward by one position, making the text unreadable to anyone without the decryption key.

**Usage**

-Run the script enc.py.
-Enter the text you wish to encrypt in the provided input field.
-Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the encrypted text.

**Running the Scripts**

To run the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Execute the scripts with the following commands:

For decryption:
python dec.py

For encryption:
python enc.py

# **Note**

These scripts provide a basic illustration of encryption and decryption and should not be used for sensitive or secure data. Additional security measures should be implemented for secure data handling.
